        I have been planning to read this long before lockdown, from march 16 to be exact. On that late night I have watched this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jwUXV4QaTw">wired video</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Navarro">Joe Navarro</a> and got hung up on it. I have immediately added his books on non-verbal communications to my google play library, but haven't started reading till may.

        On Sunday May 10th I woke up early in the morning and realised I have not been using my time super productively, I'm learning chess, doing some projects. But I have many other things which I wanted to do and haven't been able to allot time for them. Book reading is one of them. So, I messaged an avid book reader facebook friend of mine for book suggestions and got started with his suggestion (life's amazing secrets), And somehow I got my kickstart for books.

        Also, google play books app is cool, The coolest part is it the app creates a doc for each book and logs down the highlighted sentences with color, which makes note-taking a lot easier

        Coming to the organisation of this post, The author explains many aspects of non-verbal communications mostly quoting an example for each case.
        I will log down the important points, may be in tabular form for now and format it when I have finished reading the entire book.
