Ah I remember that from before, I have read/experienced it some where else. We all have must have had that moment sometimes. Well I did too.

Human memory is amazing isn't it. Many researchers out there are banging their heads trying to figure it out.  Especially how it works when it comes to patterns. 

This is an very old book (1968) by [Alexander R Luria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Luria) - neuropsychologist, often credited as the father of modern [neuropsychological assessment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropsychological_assessment).

This book is more of a psychologist's record of a patient. A person who has infinite or immeasurable memory, who he describes as Mr. S. Mainly answers the question how his emotional life is?
