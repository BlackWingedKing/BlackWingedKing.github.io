Have you heard [F&uuml;r Elise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfF0zHeU3Zs) or [the moon light sonata first movement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbTVZMJ9Z2I) or [The Office opening song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrBi4rX3TKg)?. What an amazing pieces they are.
I have always wanted to learn piano, but never got a chance. I wish I enrolled in NSO musicals instead of NSS Green Campus in my freshmen year, but Green campus was fun too.

So, during this covid19 break, I joined a crash course at my hometown (I was only expecting it to last for 10 days. How short sighted was I?). Anyway my lessons got started and Our PM Modi announces junta curfew. The next day I went out with my dad and bought this [casio keyboard](https://www.amazon.in/Casio-CTX700-Sensitive-Portable-Keyboard/dp/B0794RNK5V). The day after that complete lockdown was announced. I thought myself, "How lucky am I?". But the main question that remains at this point is how am I gonna learn keyboard without an Instructor. So, I'm documenting here my efforts to learn piano under the supervision of internet sensei

I found out [this](https://courses.pianovideolessons.com/) website has some real good piano lessons. So, I'm following this one.
