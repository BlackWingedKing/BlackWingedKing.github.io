I recently got to know about this amazing website [codingame](https://www.codingame.com/), where you can improve yout coding skills by programming bots and compete with others. I wish I had known this before. This is a very good way to spend one's quarantine time. 

This post is gonna be about the fundamentals of vehicle control for this [game](https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/coders-strike-back), Where we has access to the controls of the bot. Almost all top players used somekind of genetic algorithm for control and I want to do something different. I will try to pose the problem as an optimal control problem and try to sove it.
