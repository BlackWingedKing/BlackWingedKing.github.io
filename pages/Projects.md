During my Undergrad, I spent 3 years working at [Innovation cell](http://www.umiciitb.com/) IIT Bombay, during this time, I have worked on various Technical projects including the Self-Driving Car. Later I started working on a Research Project under [Prof. Subhasis Chaudhari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subhasis_Chaudhuri) of EE dept. This is kind of a turning point and I slowly got more and more inclined towards research. I'm grateful enough to do my undergrad project with [Prof. Vivek Borkar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivek_Borkar) and [Prof. Nikhil Karamchandani](https://sites.google.com/site/nikhilkaram/).
