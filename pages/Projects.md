During my Undergrad, I spent 3 years working at [Innovation cell](http://www.umiciitb.com/) IIT Bombay, during this time, I have worked on various Technical projects including the Self-Driving Car. Later I started working on a Research Project under Prof. Subhasis Chaudhari of EE dept. This is kind of a turning point and I slowly got more and more inclined towards research. I'm grateful enough to do my undergrad project with Prof. Vivek Borkar and Prof. Nikhil Karamchandani.
