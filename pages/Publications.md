### <u>Batch Decorrelation for Active Metric Learning</u>
We present an active learning strategy for training parametric models of distance metrics, given triplet-based similarity assessments: object \(x_{i}\) is more similar to object \(x_{j}\) than to \(x_{k}\). In contrast to prior work on class-based learning, where the fundamental goal is classification and any implicit or explicit metric is binary, we focus on *perceptual* metrics that express the *degree* of (dis)similarity between objects. We find that standard active learning approaches degrade when annotations are requested for *batches* of triplets at a time: our studies suggest that correlation among triplets is responsible. In this work, we propose a novel method to *decorrelate* batches of triplets, that jointly balances informativeness and diversity while decoupling the choice of heuristic for each criterion. Experiments indicate our method is general, adaptable, and outperforms the state-of-the-art.
