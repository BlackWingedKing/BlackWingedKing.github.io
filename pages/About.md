I am a fourth-year undergraduate in Electrical Engineering at [IIT Bombay](http://iitb.ac.in/). I'm currently doing my undergrad project on distributed SGD with straggler mitigation with [Prof. Vivek Bokar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivek_Borkar) and [Prof. Nikhil Karamchandani](https://sites.google.com/site/nikhilkaram/). I'm also working with [Prof. Subhasis Chaudhari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subhasis_Chaudhuri) on Active learning for Distance Metric Learning.

I spent my summers as a visiting research student at Purdue University under Prof. [Juan Wachs](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~jpwachs/) in [ISAT lab](https://engineering.purdue.edu/isat/), where I worked on Imitation Learning methods for Robotic Surgery

I spent 3 years working at [Innovation cell](http://www.umiciitb.com/) IIT Bombay, where I have worked on various technical projects. I was the vision lead for SeDriCa Team. I was one of the 7 members of the winning team of ASME-SDC world finals held at Tampa Florida.
